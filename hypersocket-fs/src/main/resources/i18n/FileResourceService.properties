filesystems.label=File Resources
filesystems.infoHtml=<strong>File Resources</strong> allow you to mount local folders or external remote file systems. When assigned to your users they \
     will be able to access the resources through the web interface or by any other file access protocols you have installed on the server. \
    Both the types of mount and file access protocols supported depend on the level of licensing of this product.

	on the application). ON_CALL means the file system is queried on all file access operations and is the slowest method.

category.windows.label=Windows/SMB

jcifs.smb.client.username=Default Username 
jcifs.smb.client.username.info=The default username used if not specified in an SMB URL.
jcifs.smb.client.password=Default Password
jcifs.smb.client.password.info=The default password used if not specified in an SMB URL.
jcifs.smb.client.domain=Default Domain
jcifs.smb.client.domain.info=The default authentication domain used if not specified in an SMB URL.
jcifs.netbios.wins=WINS Server
jcifs.netbios.wins.info=The IP address of the WINS server. This is only required when accessing hosts on different subnets although it is recomended if a WINS server is provided.
jcifs.netbios.baddr=Broadcast Address
jcifs.netbios.baddr.info=The local network's broadcast address. It may be necessary to set this for certain network configurations because the default of 255.255.255.255 may otherwise throw a "Network is unreachable" IOException. For example if the local host's IP address is 192.168.1.15, the broadcast address would likely be 192.168.1.255.
jcifs.netbios.scope=Scope ID
jcifs.netbios.scope.info=This is extremely rare but NetBIOS provides for a "scope id" to be used in a attempt to conceal groups of machines on the same network. Ask your network administrator if scope id is used. If so, it must be set using this property or name queries will fail.
jcifs.smb.client.laddr=Local Interface
jcifs.smb.client.laddr.info=The IP address of the local interface the client should bind to if it is different from the default. For example if the client is to be used over a dial-up connection the IP address of the PPP interface may need to be specified with this property.
jcifs.netbios.laddr=NetBIOS Interface
jcifs.netbios.laddr.info=The IP address of the local interface the client should bind to for name queries if it is different from the default.
jcifs.netbios.lmhosts=LMHOSTS File
jcifs.netbios.lmhosts.info=The path to an lmhosts file containing a map of IP addresses to hostnames. The format of this file is identical to that of the Windows lmhosts file format. See Setting Name Resoultion Properties for details.
jcifs.encoding=Default Encoding
jcifs.encoding.info=If the locale character encoding of the target server is not MS-DOS Latin-1, this property needs to be changed to reflect the proper encoding (e.g. Cp866 for Russian). Otherwise, share names, passwords, and in some cases file and directory names that contain non ASCII characters may not be handled properly. See this list of Supported Encodings and concentrate on the ones attributed as MS-DOS encodings. By default this property is Cp860 which is MS-DOS Latin1. Note: The Cp860 charset converter is located in jre/lib/charsets.jar which AFAIK is only supported by the internationalized version of Sun's JRE. If Cp860 is not available an exception will occur. To avoid this exception you can set jcifs.encoding to ASCII but share names and passwords with non-ASCII characters will not be processed correctly. To determine if jCIFS is properly processing these characters create a share that contains non-ASCII characers (e.g. Grüße) and then try to list that share with the ListFiles.java example program. As of jcifs-1.2.8 this property no longer defaults to the file.encoding system property because it was almost always meaningless (e.g. usually it's UTF-8 on Linux and no CIFS server currently emits UTF-8).
jcifs.smb.client.useExtendedSecurity=Extended Security
jcifs.smb.client.useExtendedSecurity.info=True by default but this must be set to false for Samba 3.0.x as it seems older versions of Samba do not support *raw* NTLMSSP and currently JCIFS does not support SPNEGO.

fs.generateChangeEvents=Change Events
fs.generateChangeEvents.info=During reconcile generate events for any files that have changed, been removed or added since the last reconcile.

Use with caution!</strong>

fs.initialReconcileDepth=Initial Depth
fs.initialReconcileDepth.info=The initial reconcile performed during resource creation will limit folder recursion to the depth value specified. The higher the depth the longer it may take to create the initial resource.
fs.reconcileSuccessInterval=Reconcile Interval (Success)
fs.reconcileSuccessInterval.info=The number of minutes between successful reconcile events.

fs.includeFilter=Include
fs.includeFilter.info=You may specify any number of include filters using file extensions or regular expressions.
fs.excludeFilter=Exclude
fs.excludeFilter.info=You may specify any number of exclude filters using file extensions or regular expressions. Exclude filters are applied after the include filter.

fs.reconcileEnabled=Enable Reconcile
fs.reconcileEnabled.info=The system will attempt to reconcile the file system and cache file information for a better user experience and to monitor the file system to generate events. You may disable it here. Please also note that not all configurations can be reconciled. If you use custom attributes in the user, password or path fields reconciles will automatically be disabled.
fs.events.label=Events
fs.rebuildOnNextReconcile=Rebuild Cache
fs.rebuildOnNextReconcile.info=If the reconcile keeps failing or you have other issues you may want to rebuild the file cache.

fileSettings.title=Configuration

category.fsEvents.label=Events
fsEvents.excludeFilter=Exclude Filter
fsEvents.excludeFilter.info=You may exclude certain files from firing file access events. You may find this useful for system related files that are often open by an operating system when browsing folders.

fs.cache.label=Cache
error.between30and86400=Enter a value between 30 and 86400
fs.invalidateCacheSeconds=Invalidate Threshold
fs.invalidateCacheSeconds.info=The number of seconds before a file cache is invalidated. As users browse the file system the directory listings are cached to prevent constant traffic between the server and the external file system. When the cached items are older than this threshold the files will be re-synchronized with the server.
